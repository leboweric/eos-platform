## Prospect Scoring Logic

The system automatically scores prospects based on:

- **Using competitor** (Ninety.io, Bloom Growth): +10 points
- **Bad competitor review** (‚â§3 stars): +10 points  
- **Has EOS job titles** (Integrator, Visionary): +8 points
- **Right company size** (10-250 employees): +5 points
- **High growth rate** (>20% YoY): +5 points
- **Recent funding**: +3 points

**Tiers:**
- üî• **Hot** (15+ points): Ready to buy, approach immediately
- ‚ö° **Warm** (8-14 points): Nurture with targeted content
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Cold** (0-7 points): Monitor for future signals

## Testing the System

### Quick Test Flow

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Test Company",
    "website": "testcompany.com",
    "using_competitor": "ninety_io",
    "employee_count": 50
  }'
```

2. **Check the dashboard** at `/prospects`
3. **Run enrichment** to see Apollo data populate
4. **View prospect details** to see contacts and signals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No prospects showing"**
- Check you're logged in as admin
- Verify database migration ran successfully
- Check browser console for API errors

**"Enrichment not working"**
- Verify APOLLO_API_KEY is set in .env
- Check you have API credits remaining
- Look at backend logs for error messages

**"Scraping returns no results"**
- G2/Capterra may have changed their HTML structure
- Check if manual access to review sites works
- Consider using Apify's pre-built actors instead
