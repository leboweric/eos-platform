# Patent Implementation Checklist - Critical Features Needed

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING
The current implementation has only ~10-15% of the features claimed in the provisional patent. Most core innovations are NOT implemented.

## Priority 1: Core Patent Claims (MUST HAVE)

### 1. Universal Data Schema ❌
**Current**: EOS-specific database schema
**Needed**:
- [ ] Refactor database to methodology-agnostic structure
- [ ] Add `framework_type` field to all major tables
- [ ] Add `custom_attributes` JSON field for framework-specific data
- [ ] Create `framework_mappings` table
- [ ] Implement data abstraction layer

**Files to modify**:
- Database migration scripts
- All model files in `/backend/src/models/`

### 2. Dynamic Translation Engine ❌
**Current**: Simple label replacement
**Needed**:
- [ ] Build translation service that transforms data structures
- [ ] Implement business logic adapters for each framework
- [ ] Create calculation method transformers (binary vs graduated scoring)
- [ ] Add workflow transformation rules
- [ ] Implement data attribute mapping

**New files needed**:
- `/backend/src/services/translationEngine.js`
- `/backend/src/adapters/frameworkAdapters/`
- `/backend/src/transformers/dataTransformers.js`

### 3. Framework-Specific Behaviors ❌
**Current**: All frameworks behave identically
**Needed**:
- [ ] EOS: Binary completion (done/not done) for Rocks
- [ ] OKR: Graduated scoring (0.0 to 1.0) for Key Results
- [ ] 4DX: Lead/Lag measure tracking
- [ ] Scaling Up: Quarterly themes and critical numbers
- [ ] Different progress visualization per framework

**Files to modify**:
- `/frontend/src/components/priorities/PriorityCard.jsx`
- `/backend/src/controllers/prioritiesController.js`

## Priority 2: Differentiating Features

### 4. Hybrid Framework Support ❌
**Current**: Single framework for entire organization
**Needed**:
- [ ] Allow different frameworks per business area
- [ ] Meeting structures independent of goal framework
- [ ] Mix-and-match framework components
- [ ] Department-level framework selection

### 5. Intelligent Framework Recommendation ❌
**Current**: No recommendation system
**Needed**:
- [ ] Organization analysis algorithm
- [ ] Framework scoring system
- [ ] Recommendation UI component
- [ ] Performance tracking by framework

### 6. Historical Data Recontextualization ❌
**Current**: No historical transformation
**Needed**:
- [ ] View past data through new framework lens
- [ ] Automatic score/progress conversion
- [ ] Historical performance comparison

## Priority 3: Supporting Features

### 7. Framework Evolution Tracking ❌
**Current**: No change history
**Needed**:
- [ ] Track framework changes over time
- [ ] Performance metrics by framework period
- [ ] Evolution visualization

### 8. Advanced Visualizations ❌
**Current**: Same views for all frameworks
**Needed**:
- [ ] EOS: VTO (Vision/Traction Organizer)
- [ ] OKR: OKR Tree visualization
- [ ] 4DX: Scoreboard view
- [ ] Scaling Up: One-Page Strategic Plan

## Implementation Status Summary

| Feature Category | Claimed | Implemented | Gap |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Core Architecture | Universal schema, Translation engine | Basic labels only | 90% |
| Framework Switching | Full transformation | Label changes | 85% |
| Business Logic | Framework-specific | None | 100% |
| Visualizations | Dynamic per framework | Static | 100% |
| Intelligence | Recommendations, Analysis | None | 100% |
| Hybrid Support | Granular mixing | None | 100% |

## Minimum Viable Patent Implementation

To honestly claim the patent innovations, at minimum you need:

1. **Database refactoring** to universal schema (2-3 weeks)
2. **Translation engine** with actual data transformation (2 weeks)
3. **Framework-specific behaviors** for at least 2 frameworks (1-2 weeks)
4. **Different visualizations** per framework (1 week)

**Total estimated time**: 6-8 weeks of development

## Recommendation

**URGENT**: The provisional patent significantly overstates the current implementation. You have three options:

1. **Implement missing features** (6-8 weeks minimum)
2. **File continuation with reduced scope** matching actual implementation
3. **Update marketing/patent to reflect reality** (terminology customization platform)

The current gap between claims and reality could be problematic if challenged.
