# Adaptive Business Framework Platform - Provisional Patent Description

## 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to business management software systems, and more particularly to a computer-implemented method and system for enabling organizations to dynamically adapt their operational software between different business methodologies and frameworks without requiring data migration, system reconfiguration, or loss of historical information. This invention addresses the fundamental problem of organizational evolution, where companies naturally outgrow or need to change their operational frameworks but are locked into rigid software systems designed for single methodologies.

## 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Business organizations worldwide adopt various operational frameworks to structure their growth and manage their operations. Popular frameworks include the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX), Scaling Up (Rockefeller Habits), and numerous proprietary methodologies. Each framework has its own terminology, cadences, structures, and philosophical approaches to business management.

Currently, software solutions in this space are framework-specific. For example, Ninety.io, Bloom Growth, and Traction Tools exclusively serve organizations using EOS. Weekdone and Gtmhub are built specifically for OKRs. Scaling Up practitioners use Align or Rhythm Systems. This rigid framework-specific approach creates several critical problems:

**Migration Impossibility:** When an organization evolves beyond its current framework or decides to adopt a different methodology, it must abandon its existing software platform entirely. This means losing years of historical data, institutional knowledge, and established workflows. The cost and disruption of switching platforms often locks organizations into suboptimal frameworks simply because the switching cost is too high.

**Data Loss and Fragmentation:** Organizations attempting to switch frameworks must export their data from one system and attempt to import it into another, but the fundamental incompatibility between framework-specific data models means significant information is lost in translation. A "Rock" in EOS has different attributes and behaviors than a "Key Result" in OKRs, making true data portability impossible.

**Hybrid Approach Limitations:** Many organizations benefit from using elements of multiple frameworks - for example, using EOS meeting structures while adopting OKR goal-setting principles. Current solutions force an all-or-nothing choice, preventing organizations from crafting hybrid approaches that best suit their needs.

**Consultant Lock-in:** Business consultants who specialize in multiple frameworks must purchase and maintain separate software subscriptions for each methodology they support, creating inefficiency and added costs.

## 3. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves these problems through a revolutionary adaptive architecture that separates data storage from presentation, enabling seamless transitions between business frameworks while preserving complete data integrity and history.

At its core, the invention comprises three interconnected systems:

1. **A Universal Data Schema** that stores business information in a methodology-agnostic format, capturing the essential business concepts that exist across all frameworks while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate framework-specific nuances.

2. **A Dynamic Translation Engine** that maps universal data concepts to framework-specific terminology and structures in real-time, enabling instant switching between methodologies without any data transformation or migration.

3. **An Intelligent UI Generation System** that dynamically creates framework-appropriate interfaces, workflows, and visualizations based on the selected methodology, ensuring users experience a native, purpose-built application regardless of their chosen framework.

The system enables organizations to switch between frameworks instantly - what was a "Rock" in EOS becomes a "Key Result" in OKRs, complete with appropriate attributes, behaviors, and visualizations. Historical data is preserved and recontextualized appropriately, allowing organizations to view their past performance through the lens of their current framework.

## 4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 4.1 System Architecture

The Adaptive Business Framework Platform employs a multi-layered architecture that fundamentally decouples data storage from presentation logic.

**Universal Data Layer:**
At the foundation, all business data is stored in a universal schema that captures common business concepts across all frameworks. For example, instead of storing "Rocks" (EOS) or "Key Results" (OKRs) or "WIGs" (4DX), the system stores "quarterly_priorities" with a rich set of attributes that can accommodate the needs of any framework:

```
quarterly_priority {
  id: unique_identifier
  title: text
  description: text
  owner: user_reference
  due_date: date
  progress: percentage
  status: enumeration
  measurements: array[metrics]
  milestones: array[checkpoints]
  parent_objective: reference
  child_tasks: array[references]
  custom_attributes: json
}
```

**Translation Engine:**
The translation engine maintains comprehensive mapping tables that define how universal concepts map to framework-specific terminology:

```
TranslationMap {
  EOS: {
    quarterly_priority: "Rock",
    weekly_meeting: "Level 10 Meeting",
    long_term_goal: "3-Year Picture",
    annual_goal: "1-Year Plan"
  },
  OKR: {
    quarterly_priority: "Key Result",
    weekly_meeting: "Check-in",
    long_term_goal: "Mission",
    annual_goal: "Annual Objectives"
  },
  4DX: {
    quarterly_priority: "WIG",
    weekly_meeting: "WIG Session",
    long_term_goal: "Destination Postcard",
    annual_goal: "Annual Targets"
  }
}
```

**Dynamic UI Generator:**
The UI generation system reads the current framework selection and dynamically constructs appropriate interfaces. This goes beyond simple label changes - it restructures entire workflows, adjusts meeting templates, modifies calculation logic, and presents data in framework-appropriate visualizations.

### 4.2 Method of Operation

The system operates through the following process:

**Step 1: Framework Selection**
When a user selects or changes their operational framework, the system triggers a comprehensive UI regeneration process. This selection can be manual (user choice) or automatic (based on AI recommendations).

**Step 2: Translation Activation**
The translation engine loads the appropriate mapping configuration for the selected framework. This includes terminology mappings, business logic rules, calculation methods, and display preferences specific to that framework.

**Step 3: UI Regeneration**
The interface dynamically reconstructs itself to match the selected framework's conventions. Menu items, form fields, dashboard widgets, and reports all adapt to use framework-appropriate terminology and layouts. For example, an EOS view shows a "VTO" (Vision/Traction Organizer) while an OKR view displays an "OKR Tree" - both visualizing the same underlying data differently.

**Step 4: Logic Adaptation**
Business logic adjusts to match framework requirements. EOS "Rocks" are binary (done/not done) while OKR "Key Results" use graduated scoring (0.0 to 1.0). The system automatically adjusts calculation methods, progress tracking, and scoring mechanisms to match framework expectations.

**Step 5: Historical Recontextualization**
Previous data is reinterpreted through the new framework's lens. Past "Rocks" appear as historical "Key Results" when switching to OKRs, with appropriate score translations and progress interpretations.

### 4.3 Innovative Features

**Hybrid Framework Support:**
Organizations can select different frameworks for different aspects of their operations. For example:
- Use EOS meeting structures
- Adopt OKR goal-setting methods
- Apply 4DX scoreboard visualizations
- Implement Scaling Up hiring processes

**Intelligent Framework Recommendation:**
The system analyzes organizational metrics and characteristics to recommend optimal frameworks:
- Company size and growth rate
- Industry vertical
- Team distribution (remote vs. co-located)
- Current performance metrics
- Cultural indicators

**Framework Evolution Tracking:**
The system maintains a complete history of framework transitions, allowing organizations to analyze which methodologies were most effective during different growth phases.

**Consultant Mode:**
Enables consultants to manage multiple client organizations, each using different frameworks, from a single account with instant context switching.

### 4.4 Technical Implementation Details

    calculations: mapping.calculations[universalConcept.type],
    display: mapping.displayRules[universalConcept.type]
  }
  return applyFrameworkLogic(translatedConcept, targetFramework)
}
```

*Framework Compatibility Scoring:*
```
function scoreFrameworkFit(organizationMetrics, frameworkCharacteristics) {
  score = 0
  score += matchSizeRange(organizationMetrics.employeeCount, frameworkCharacteristics.idealSize)
  score += matchComplexity(organizationMetrics.complexity, frameworkCharacteristics.complexity)
  score += matchCulture(organizationMetrics.culture, frameworkCharacteristics.culturalFit)
  score += matchIndustry(organizationMetrics.industry, frameworkCharacteristics.industryFit)
  return normalizeScore(score)
}
```

**1. Zero Migration Cost:** Organizations can switch frameworks instantly without any data migration, export/import processes, or system downtime.

**2. Complete Historical Preservation:** All historical data remains accessible and is automatically recontextualized in the new framework's terminology and structure.

**3. Framework Agility:** Organizations can experiment with different methodologies, adopt hybrid approaches, or evolve their framework as they grow without software constraints.

**4. Reduced Software Costs:** Instead of purchasing multiple framework-specific tools, organizations need only one adaptive platform.

**5. Consultant Efficiency:** Business consultants can serve clients using any framework from a single platform, reducing costs and complexity.

**6. Future-Proof Architecture:** As new business frameworks emerge, they can be added to the system through configuration rather than requiring fundamental architectural changes.

**7. Improved Decision Making:** Organizations can view their data through multiple framework lenses, gaining insights that would be impossible with framework-locked systems.

**8. Seamless Transitions:** When organizations hire new executives or consultants favoring different frameworks, the transition is seamless and non-disruptive.

**9. Merger & Acquisition Compatibility:** Companies using different frameworks can merge their operations without forcing either to abandon their methodology.

**10. Continuous Evolution:** Organizations can gradually evolve their methodology over time rather than making jarring wholesale changes.

This invention represents a fundamental shift in how business management software is conceived and constructed, moving from rigid, framework-specific tools to an adaptive, evolution-friendly platform that grows with organizations throughout their entire lifecycle.
