# Scorecard Notes Display Fix - Test Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `GroupedScorecardView.jsx`
- Added `MessageSquare` icon import from lucide-react
- Added `weeklyNotes` and `monthlyNotes` props to component parameters
- Added notes retrieval logic in `renderMetricRow` function
- Added notes display logic in score cells with conditional icon rendering
- Added tooltip to show notes on hover

### 2. Updated `ScorecardPageClean.jsx`
- Fixed missing `weeklyNotes` and `monthlyNotes` props in monthly GroupedScorecardView

## How the Fix Works

1. **Backend**: Already correctly sends notes in separate `weeklyNotes` and `monthlyNotes` objects
2. **Frontend**: 
   - ScorecardPageClean receives and stores notes separately from scores
   - Passes notes to both ScorecardTableClean and GroupedScorecardView components
   - Components check for notes existence and display MessageSquare icon when notes are present

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Scorecard page
2. Add a score with notes to any metric
3. Verify that a small MessageSquare icon appears next to the score
4. Hover over the score to see the notes in a tooltip
5. Test in both Table View and Groups View
6. Test for both Weekly and Monthly tabs

## Technical Details

- Notes are stored in the `scorecard_scores` table in the `notes` column
- Notes are fetched separately from scores to maintain clean data separation
- Icon visibility is determined by: `hasNotes = noteValue && noteValue.length > 0`
- Icon styling: `MessageSquare className="inline-block ml-1 h-3 w-3 opacity-60"`
