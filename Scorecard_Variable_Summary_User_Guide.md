# User Guide: New Feature - Customize Your Scorecard Summaries!

We're excited to introduce a powerful new feature that gives you more control over how your scorecard metrics are summarized. You can now assign a unique summary calculation to **each individual metric**, ensuring the data you see aligns perfectly with your goals.

## Why Use Custom Summaries?

Not all metrics are the same. Some are cumulative (like sales revenue), while others are averages (like response time). This feature allows you to match the summary calculation to the metric's purpose.

Here’s a quick guide on which summary type to use for different kinds of metrics:

| Metric Type | Example | Recommended Summary Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cumulative** | Sales Revenue, Deals Closed | **Quarterly Total** |
| **Averages** | Avg. Response Time, Tickets/Week | **Weekly/Monthly Average** |
| **Snapshots** | Team Headcount, Inventory Level | **Latest Value** |

---

## How to Use the "Summary Display" Setting

It's easy to set up. Just follow these three steps.

### Step 1: Find the Setting

First, navigate to the main **Scorecard** page. From there, either click the **"+ Add Metric"** button to create a new metric or click the **Edit (pencil) icon** on an existing metric.

Inside the metric dialog, look for the new **"Summary Display"** dropdown menu, located right below the "Frequency" setting.

*(Screenshot: A picture of the metric edit dialog with a red box highlighting the "Summary Display" dropdown menu.)*

### Step 2: Choose Your Summary Type

Next, select the summary type that best fits your metric. Here are the available options and what they do:

| Option | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weekly Average** | Metrics measured as a weekly average (e.g., Avg. Customer Satisfaction). This is the default. |
| **Monthly Average** | Metrics measured as a monthly average. |
| **Quarterly Total** | Cumulative goals where you want to see the sum of all scores in the quarter (e.g., Quarterly Sales Revenue). |
| **Quarterly Average** | Metrics where you want to see the average of all scores within the quarter. |
| **Latest Value** | "Snapshot" metrics where you only care about the most recent value (e.g., Team Headcount, Current Inventory). |

### Step 3: Save Your Metric

Once you've selected your desired summary type, click the **"Save"** button. That's it!

## What to Expect: The New Summary Column

After setting a custom summary type, the summary column on your scorecard (previously labeled "Q4 Avg") will now display a tailored calculation for that metric.

#### **In L10 Meetings:**

You'll see an enhanced, detailed view:
*   A **colored badge** (green for on-track, red for off-track) showing the summary value.
*   The **goal** displayed clearly below.
*   A **percentage** indicating progress toward the goal.

*(Screenshot: A picture of the scorecard view within an L10 meeting. One metric shows a "Quarterly Total" of $325,000 with a goal of $400,000 and "(81%)". Another metric below it shows a "Weekly Average" of 48.)*

#### **On the Main Scorecard Page:**

You'll see a more compact view, showing the summary value and the goal (e.g., "325,000 / 400,000").

## Important Notes

*   **Existing Metrics:** All of your existing metrics have been automatically set to **"Weekly Average"** to ensure there is no disruption. You can edit any metric at any time to change its summary type.
*   **Flexibility:** Feel free to experiment with the different summary types to see which one provides the most clarity for your team.

We believe this feature will make your scorecard more insightful and actionable. As always, we welcome your feedback!
