# Login Page Design Analysis

## Initial Observations

### Current Design Elements

**Left Side (Marketing Content):**
- AXP logo with green/blue gradient
- Tagline: "Beyond Traditional Business Software"
- Headline: "Welcome Back to The Business Software That Adapts"
- Subheadline describing the platform
- Three feature cards with colored icons
- Target audience list at bottom

**Right Side (Login Form):**
- "Welcome back" heading
- Email and password fields
- "Keep me signed in" checkbox
- "Sign in to AXP" button (bright blue/purple)
- Google and Microsoft SSO buttons
- "Start your free trial" CTA
- Footer with Terms, Privacy, Support links
- Security badges at bottom

### Issues Identified

1. **Visual Clutter**: Too much marketing copy on a login page
2. **Color Scheme**: Bright blue/purple button may be too vibrant
3. **Layout Balance**: Left side feels heavy with content
4. **Branding**: Logo is small and could be more prominent
5. **Form Styling**: Input fields could be more refined
6. **Trust Signals**: Security badges are small and at the bottom
